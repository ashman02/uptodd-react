      <h2>Welcome to the World of UpTodd early development! </h2>
      <h3>Hello, Dear Parent!</h3>
      <p>Welcome to the World of UpTodd early development! We are delighted to have you here. UpTodd was born from the dreams of three friends—Abhishek, Devesh, and Richa—who believed that every child deserves a bright and joyful start. Their journey began in the inspiring halls of IITs, driven by personal stories of resilience and hope. Sharing a common vision, they set out to bring a touch of wonder to early baby development.</p>

      <h3>The Birth of a Dream</h3>
      
      <p>In 2015, Abhishek, Devesh, and Richa launched an NGO dedicated to giving every child a strong start in education. They noticed a common desire among parents: to offer the best for their children's early baby development. This observation led to a burning question: "What if?" What if they could help parents provide the right meaningful pattern of UpTodd early development for their children? This question ignited their passion and curiosity, and they embarked on a journey to find answers.</p>

      <h3>Rooted in Love and Knowledge</h3>
      <p>To bring their vision to life, they collaborated with over 100 leading experts and researchers in the field of personalised baby growth and development. They delved into more than 10,000 research studies, driven by a passion to provide the best for every child. From MIT to Stanford, IITs to AIIMS, each piece of knowledge contributed to a recipe for an UpTodd early development environment filled with joy, creativity, and love. This collaboration led to a breakthrough understanding of the importance of personalised baby growth. In 2019, UpTodd early development was born—a place where growth and happiness meet, bringing personalized attention to every child.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Parents' Hopes and Concerns</h2>

 <p>During their journey, they met over 5,000 parents and discovered a common hope in every eye: to give their children the best start for customised baby growth and development. However, they also found a common guilt about having limited time and the overwhelming presence of screens and technology. This revealed a deeper concern about providing the right start in a world filled with challenges. The insights gathered from these interactions led to a deeper understanding of the impact of UpTodd early development experiences through play and environment.</p>
